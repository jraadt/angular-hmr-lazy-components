<h1>Angular HMR Lazy Components</h1>
<p>
  This example shows how Angular HMR can be used to reload lazy routes and lazy
  (dynamically-loaded) components.
</p>
<h2>Lazy-Loaded Dynamic Components Example: </h2>
<p>
  <em>Instructions:</em>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hit F12 to open the Chrome Dev Tools. Open the Console, so you can see HMR messages.</li>
  <li>Click on a mixture of the "Add" buttons below.  A "loading" graphic simulates the component loading its data.</li>
  <li>Click on any open component to close it.</li>
  <li>With a mixture of components open, make a change to the source code in a.component.ts. Only the instances of
    component A will be hot-reloaded. Component A is in one module, and Components B1 and B2 are in a different module.</li>
  <li>Try something similar with b1.component.ts - all B1 and B2s will refresh, because they're part of the same
    module.</li>
</ul>
 
<button (click)="loadA()">Add Component A</button>&nbsp;
<button (click)="loadB1()">Add Component B1</button>&nbsp;
<button (click)="loadB2()">Add Component B2</button>
<p></p>
<div #componentOutlet></div>
 
<h2>Lazy-Loaded Routes Example: </h2>
<p>
  <em>Instructions:</em>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the link below to navigate to the lazy route C. A component with a "C" in it will appear below the link, where the router-outlet is.</li>
  <li>Make a change to the source code in c.component.ts. The router will reset and reload the route, showing the updated
    component.</li>
</ul>
<a routerLink="/c/c1">Click me to navigate to the lazy route C1</a><br/>
<a routerLink="/c/c2">Click me to navigate to the lazy route C2</a>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
